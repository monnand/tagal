# Self Introduction #
Dear Prof. Mao:

When I visited your homepage I found that you are looking for students who are interested in computer networking. Perhaps I am the one you wanted.

My name is Deng Nan and I will graduate in the year of 2009 from Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication (BUPT, http://www.bupt.edu.cn) with a BE degree on Telecommunication Engineering and I will also obtain a BE degree from the school of Queen Mary, University of London majored in Telecommunication Engineering with Management. I would like to go to the United States for my further education. Here is a brief introduction of my experience:

When I was a junior high school student, I learnt C programming language by myself. I joined a software research project in the Chinese Academy of Sciences of Software (http://www.ios.ac.cn) when I was in my senior high school. During that time, I designed and implemented a spam filter independently using C programming language and Perl script language under Linux Email server platform. In addition to my regular school work, I read several RFCs and papers, familiar with computer programming and Linux system. I also learnt probability theory, basic AI theory, data mining and machine learning, especial Bayesian network, which is finally used in my system. And this spam filter system was used on the email server successfully in Chinese Academy of Science of Software.

During senior high school years, I was chosen to work in the Network Security Lab in the Institute of High Energy Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.ihep.ac.cn) as a student of Professor Xu Rong’sheng, who has imported the first Internet line into China and is called “The Father of Chinese Internet”. From then on, I went to this lab frequently to learn the skills about network security.

In the second year in university, I became a team member in Xu's lab for a research project to design an algorithm to detect pirated software in a computer and implement it based on network in C/S fashion. Soon I was put in charge of the design and implementation of the core-functional module. My experience of Bayesian nets and computer networking continues to serve me well in this research during algorithm design and coding stage. This research ended up with a real product, and was purchased by the Copyright Bureau of the Municipal Government of Cheng Du to achieve their daily work.

As a third-year-college student, I was employed temporarily by a company of Capital Online (http://www.263.com) to implement an online service consulting system (http://kf.263.com). I am in charge of the implementation of server side and some part of client side. Both of these works are written in C++ with MFC under Windows system.

Now, I have just joined an open source project named Scilab (http://www.scilab.org) in LIAMA (i.e.Sino French Lab in Computer Science, Automation and Applied Mathematics) in the Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.ia.ac.cn). I am a sub-leader of this project to implement a simulator for Scilab like Simulink for Matlab.

I am the founder and maintainer of an open source project named tagal (http://tagal.googlecode.com). It is written in C with GTK+ works under UNIX/UNIX-like system, and maintained now and then during my spare time. I have translated a paper from English to Chinese about peer-to-peer transmission and proposed the work to my blog (http://blog.csdn.net/monnand). In my blog, I also analyzed some source code from Apache, qmail, fechmail and some code of mine. These essays are in Chinese and I will initiate another open-source project aims to collect articles about code analysis of open source software. In this project, I will translate my works into English to share with more people. After I translated the paper about peer-to-peer network, I have also read some related papers about peer-to-peer system and complex network. Then I found an open source project aims to implement a peer-to-peer transmission system optimized for real-time-stream (http://sourceforge.net/projects/voila/). This is written by C++ using a portable library named Poco. However, this project was suspended because of unexpected illness during development and does not have a release version. But the code is available on svn.

In university, I have also achieved some course work about networking. One of them could be download here: http://tagal.googlecode.com/files/lantoolkit-1.0.tar.bz2, which is a sort of tools to detect hosts in LAN along with a small host scanner.

I have given five lectures about free/open source software for computer-majored students in my university, which made me feel freely when speaking in front of hundreds of people. I am also a fluent user of Linux, LaTeX with skillful programming ability in C/C++, Java and Perl, quite familiar with Linux kernel, Mysql, sqlite. I also have some experience about computer networking, network security, artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, especially about Bayesian network.

I hope I could achieve my master degree in computer networking area and I am very interested in your current research in RobustNet group.I believe I can be a qualified student of you and learn a lot from you. I will take GRE and TOEFL tests later this year. If you think I am suitable for your project, please let me know.

Thank you for reading my introduction and looking forward to your favorable reply.

Sincerely yours,

Deng Nan
