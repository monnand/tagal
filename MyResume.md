# Self-introduction #
For details, see: [my CV](http://tagal.googlecode.com/files/CV.pdf).

When I was a junior high school student, I learned C programming language by myself. I joined a software research project in the Chinese Academy of Sciences of Software (http://www.ios.ac.cn) when I was in my senior high school. During that time, I designed and implemented a spam filter system independently using C programming language and Perl script language under Linux Email server platform. In addition to my regular work in high school, I read several RFCs and papers, familiar with
computer programming and Linux system. I also learned probability theory, basic AI theory, data mining and machine learning, especial Bayesian network, which is used in my system. This research work lasted for 3 years and finally the spam filter system was used on the email server successfully in Chinese Academy of Science of Software.

During senior high school years, I was chosen to work in the Network Security Lab in the Institute of High Energy Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.ihep.ac.cn) as a student of Professor Xu Rong’sheng, who has imported the first Internet line into China and is called “The Father of Chinese Internet”. From then on, I went to this lab frequently to learn the skills about network security.

In the second year in university, I became a team member in Xu's lab for a research project to design an algorithm to detect pirated software in a computer and implement it based on network in C/S fashion. Soon I was put in charge of the design and implementation of the core-functional module. My experience of Bayesian nets and computer networking continues to serve me well in this research during algorithm design and coding stage. This research ended up with a real product, and was purchased by the Copyright Bureau of the Municipal Government of Cheng Du to achieve their daily work.

As a third-year-college student, I was employed temporarily by a company of Capital Online (http://www.263.com) to implement an online service consulting system (http://kf.263.com). I am in charge of the implementation of server side and some part of client side. Both of these works are written in C++ with MFC under Windows system.

Now, I have just joined an open source project named Scilab (http://www.scilab.org) in LIAMA (i.e.Sino French Lab in Computer
Science, Automation and Applied Mathematics) in the Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.ia.ac.cn). I am a sub-leader of this project to implement a simulator for Scilab like Simulink for Matlab.

I am the founder and maintainer of an open source project named tagal (http://tagal.googlecode.com). It is written in C with GTK+ works under UNIX/UNIX-like system, and maintained now and then during my spare time. I have translated a paper from English to Chinese about peer-to-peer transmission and proposed the work to my blog (http://blog.csdn.net/monnand). In my blog, I also analyzed some source code from Apache, qmail, fechmail and some code of mine. These essays are in Chinese and I will initiate another open-source project aims to collect articles about code analysis of open source software. In this project, I will translate my works into English to share with more people. After I translated the paper about peer-to-peer network, I have also read some related papers about peer-to-peer system and complex network. Then I found an open source project aims to implement a
peer-to-peer transmission system optimized for real-time-stream (http://sourceforge.net/projects/voila/). This is written by C++ using a portable library named Poco. However, this project was suspended because of unexpected illness during development and does not have a release version. But the code is available on svn.

I have given several lectures about free/open source software for computer-majored students in my university, which made me feel freely when speaking in front of hundreds of people. I am also a fluent user of Linux, LaTeX with skillful programming ability in C/C++, Java and Perl, quite familiar with Linux kernel, Mysql, sqlite. I also have some experience about computer networking, network security, artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, especially about Bayesian network.

I will graduate in the year of 2009 from Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication (BUPT) with a BE degree on Telecommunication Engineering and I will also obtain a BE degree from the school of Queen Mary, University of London majored in Telecommunication Engineering with Management.
