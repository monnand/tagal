# Introduction #
This package includes several programs.

A little soft to detect host in LAN --- which sends  ARP packets to every IP in LAN and receive replies to list all host and their IPs in LAN.

Another one is a chain of program to implement a scanner.

The report of this course work can be found in docs/report.pdf whose first chapter (``_Finding the Information of the Computers in
the same LAN_'') is written by my classmate, others is written by myself.
