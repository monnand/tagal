[more details](http://code.google.com/p/tagal/wiki/PCM_Truth)

Finally, the original page of this work was deprecated. However, I should state some FACT here.

This program is written last year to achieve the course work of subject named ``Telecommunication System'' in university. Our teacher asked us to implement A-Law algorithm to convert a CD-quality audio (44.1KHz, PCM encoded) to phone-quality (8KHz, A-Law encoded). To simplify the task, teacher only asked us to deal with text file in which stores each value of pulse in a single line, so that we can ignore the format of audio file. Moreover, in the process of resample (i.e. change sample frequency from 44.1KHz to 8KHz), we are allowed not to use a filter.

If you can not understand what I said, then send me mail ( monnand at gmail dot com ), I will explain it for you --- or use gtalk, same address as email.

Teacher give me 9 marks out of 50 for this course work. Here is the feedback comments to explain the reason (the words quoted from my teacher is in _this_ font):

_From both the report and the code, it occurred to me that your group didn’t do the code yourself. If you look at the specification carefully, I did state that using any available libraries is not allowed for this coursework. What you have done would be fine it you wrote all the program code with your own effort; but just making use of libraries does not; I’m afraid I cannot give you any marks for that. It would be unfair to other students._

I complained for months, and put this work --- with my teacher's photo, which is why I was warned by my university --- on this project web page. Finally, I received such reasons (the words quoted from my teacher is in _this_ font) :

_Mechanism on A-Law --- you had 6/10, some theory on A-law has been included, but the application of the theorem i.e. how it is used to achieve companding is missing._

_STEP 1: Explanation of the format --- there was no information on how to deal with stereo channels and therefor no marks._

_STEP 2: Algorithm --- There was no information on the implementation algorithm. Your group has provided small section of code on P.6 but no explanation and therefore no marks._

_STEP 3: Graphs: indeed there are 2 graphs in the report, but none of the axes were labelled, is it not clear what sort of tome frame and scale is it referring to and what the ampletudes are hence no marks._

_Text file: spot check: This was not provided_ ( **How can I provide a text file then? don't understand what I said? Send me mail** )

_Overall coherent: 3/6_

_Reference: 0 as there were no reference._

**Score was NOT changed.**

I think my teacher can fond more reasons for this mark which is of course not mentioned in the original feedback.

Then, I was told this thing was over and I should delete the page I used to give a detail explanation about this event because I put my teacher's picture there --- do you want to see it?  I don't want to be invited to my teacher's room again. However, ask this question to the biggest search engine using these keywords: _"EU IST" "ADAMANT" "BEng, PhD, MIEE, MIEEE"_. It maybe gives you some result. By the way, again, my email address: monnand at gmail dot com, and also is my gtalk account.

I haven't mentioned my teacher's name here. I haven't mentioned which search engine should be used here. I haven't mentioned any thing that about my teacher's detail. I haven't uploaded any picture here. I only said some words:

o EU IST --- yes, this is not a person's name.

o ADAMANT --- only an ordinary English word.

o BEng, PhD, MIEE, MIEEE --- Nothing to do with my teacher.

OK, can you infer my teacher's image from these key words? NO! YOU CAN NOT. So, I am talking about my own story, I haven't mentioned anyone directly. Therefore, DO NOT SAY AGAIN WITH QUOTING FROM ANY DOCUMENT OR STUDENTS' DISCIPLINE THAT I DID A WRONG THING HERE.
