Under GNU/Linux, you first have to install GTK+ (>=2.0), which usually has been installed on many Linux distro. Under ubuntu, you could get GTK+ by executing following command:
```
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
```


Then, decompress [tagal-0.2.2.tar.bz2](http://tagal.googlecode.com/files/tagal-0.2.2.tar.bz2):
```
tar jxvf tagal-0.2.2.tar.bz2
```

then, enter that directory and do what you may be already familiar:
```
cd tagal-0.2.2
./configure && make
sudo make install
```

OK, tagal is there. Execute gtk-tagal and have fun.

If you want it works in a more natural way, config it follow [this](http://code.google.com/p/tagal/wiki/Config) instruction. Again, it is very simple.
