# What is Free Culture? #
_A free culture supports and protects creators and innovators. It does this directly by granting intellectual property rights. Bit it does so indirectly by limiting the reach of those rights, to guarantee that follow-on creators and innovators remain as free as possible from the control of the past._
---Lawrence Lessig, Free Culture.

# So What? #
So we need free culture. Because we need creativity, innovations and intelligence. We do not want monopoly as power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, no matter where the power comes from --- market or government, university or company.

# But what is [this](http://tagal.googlecode.com/files/freeculture.pdf)? #
Of course, it is a e-book. A e-book written by professor Lawrence Lessig from Stanford Law School under cc license. And it of course could be downloaded from [here](http://www.free-culture.cc). If you can access [this](http://www.free-culture.cc) website, this means that your government or ISP or other power has not robbed your right to access such content from Internet.

But I cannot! Because I am in a country with tense control of Internet --- controlled for political reason. So I put [this](http://tagal.googlecode.com/files/freeculture.pdf) book on this site to let people like us to access this book. I put it on main page to remind people that your freedom is all you have. If you do not defend for your freedom, you would loss it forever.

# Why they block [Free Culture](http://www.free-culture.cc)? #
Who knows. They never provide any reason when they block the Internet. They only told you that they have blocked some website contains porn information or message of destroying government. If you ask them more, they will ask you some questions like ``Do you have children'' to distort the topic.

I think none of them have read [this](http://tagal.googlecode.com/files/freeculture.pdf) book. If they did, they would find that it contains nothing to disturb the government but only a discussion about copyright laws, especially copyright laws in the U.S. Nothing to do with their power. However, none of them are intelligent enough to read this book. THEY ARE ALL IDIOT OF COURSE! (forgive me my reader. I cannot help.)
