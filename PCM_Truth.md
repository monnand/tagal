# Introduction #
I have to say something for this program.

I wrote it last year to achieve the course work of subject named ``Telecommunication System'' in university. Our teacher asked us to implement A-Law algorithm to convert a CD-quality audio (44.1KHz, PCM encoded) to phone-quality (8KHz, A-Law encoded). To simplify the task, teacher only asked us to deal with text file in which stores each value of pulse in a single line, so that we can ignore the format of audio file. Moreover, in the process of resample (i.e. change sample frequency from 44.1KHz to 8KHz), we are allowed not to use a filter.

If you can not understand what I said above, just know that our teacher let us to implement a useless program only can get score from her course, and also let our (including students and teacher) work much more easier.

So, I can not bear it. I've been programming for nearly 10 years and do not want to waste my time to do such a useless job. Consequently, my program can works with wave file and a low-pass filter was implemented.

However, after all, I should finish my course work, in order to get a paper saying "You are graduated from XXX university". Thus, I asked my teacher for a permission to let me propose my program which is, of course, beyond the instruction of course work. Fortunately (well...  and Unfortunately,) my teacher allowed.

It seems nothing happened, until I received the score of this course work --- only 9 marks out of 50, which is 36%. I asked for a reason from my teacher, and she said in her feedback that she do not believe it is my own work. Then do not reply any mail of mine. I turned to many other teachers in my school, but there isn't any works done for this fault.

The only thing I could do is propose my source code here and let friends from Internet read it. If you also do not believe that I do not have ability to write such a program, close this page, with shouts of ``A cheater's mail address is monnand at gmail dot com''.

# My ``very kind'' teacher #
OK, here is my ``very kind'' teacher XXXXX YY --- she said she do not believe this program is my own work and gave me only 9 marks out of 50.

**NOTE: I HAVE NOT mentioned my teacher's name**

And I have to emphasize some points here about her ``perfect'' job.

o She permitted me that I could propose the source code which is beyond the rules and send it individually to her. However, this permission was made after class without any evidence to prove its existence. So it is easy for her to say that she did not allow me to do it like this and my work does not abide by the rules. And this is what she did now.

o After this course, there is a feedback to explain the reason of marking for every students. In this feedback, she only pointed that the originality of my work is doubted. I send her mail and explained my work. Then I received more reasons why I got this score. Her marking standard seems do not consistent with the former one. And I think if I insist on changing my mark, she can give me more reasons which is not mentioned in the formal feedback

o Luckily, she refused to reply my email, so I could not see tons of reasons from her... It may be the best way for her to keep silent, I think.

**Here used to be a picture of my teacher. However, I was warned by my teacher and can not put it here. But I should to put something to let this page looks nice. So I uploaded a picture I drawn just to DECORATE my web page.**

**NOTE: THIS PICTURE IS ONLY USED TO SHOW MY ABILITY IN ART --- It may be not so good --- AND NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY I TOLD IN THIS PAGE**

o I have NOT mentioned which university I am in.

o I have NOT mentioned my teacher's name.

o I have NOT uploaded anyone's picture.

o I have NOT say anything which is not the fact.
