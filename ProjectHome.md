**latest version: 0.2.2. upload time: Jun-22-2008**

This program is used to add tags to files. Written in C with GTK+ and sqlite, so, theoretically, it could be ported to some widely used platform --- say, something named Windows for example. However, I only compiled it under GNU/Linux.

A lot of bugs maybe exist and I'm trying to find and fix them. Any bug report or suggestions are welcomed. Send them to monnand at gmail dot com.

If you think this soft is useless, or want to know more background of it, see [A short story of mine](http://code.google.com/p/tagal/wiki/MyStory).

Please read [Install](http://code.google.com/p/tagal/wiki/Install) before install it.

Let it works in a more convenient way, please read [Config](http://code.google.com/p/tagal/wiki/Config)

# Request for some help #
I really do not want users to add this function in
[this](http://code.google.com/p/tagal/wiki/Config) way.
So maybe a Desktop Entry is needed. But I have read some documents from
freedesktop.org and still do not know how to let it work. Any one can help me? send mail to monnand at gmail dot com

## Some passage I wrote ##
They can be found in [my blog](http://blog.csdn.net/monnand) (in Chinese.)

I translated a paper about peer-to-peer real-time transportation there.
Analyzed some source code from Apache, qmail, fechmail.
And some code of mine.

However, it is not updated frequently.

## Some opensource program I wrote ##
http://sourceforge.net/projects/voila/
A peer-to-peer real-time streaming system. However, it is not active now. I'm planning to rewrite it some day.
